👋 Hi, I’m Sebastian

👀 I’m interested in
- 🐧💻 Linux system administration
- 👨‍🔬 ⚛ science and research (I have a background in theoretical physics and chemistry)
- 🎓 education and teaching

💡 I am currently
- 📖 setting up a documentation system with MkDocs, digesting notes from Wikis, Obsidian and more
- 🌐 creating my own [website](https://sebastianerfort.github.io/) using Hugo and incorporating my [public notes](https://sebastianerfort.github.io/notes/) (again using MkDocs and [Obsidian Publisher template](https://github.com/ObsidianPublisher/mkdocs-publisher-template))
- 🚀 learning more about DevOps and CI/CD working on these and other projects
